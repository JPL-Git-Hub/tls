# Document Management System - Task Plan

## Overview
Build a complete document management system using Cubone (file operations) + Tailwind UI blocks (interface) + Catalyst components (forms/buttons).

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Cubone file manager
- [ ] Set up Firebase Storage integration for file persistence
- [ ] Create base document routes (`/dashboard/documents`)
- [ ] Implement basic file upload/download API endpoints

## Phase 2: Core File Operations (Cubone)
- [ ] File upload functionality
- [ ] File download and retrieval
- [ ] File deletion and move operations
- [ ] Folder creation and organization
- [ ] File metadata management (name, size, type, date)
- [ ] File permission and access control

## Phase 3: User Interface (TW UI Blocks)
- [ ] File upload dropzone component
- [ ] Document list/grid view layouts
- [ ] File action menus (download, share, delete)
- [ ] Search and filter interface
- [ ] File preview cards with thumbnails
- [ ] Folder navigation with breadcrumbs
- [ ] File sorting options (name, date, size, type)

## Phase 4: Integration with Catalyst
- [ ] Upload buttons using Catalyst Button component
- [ ] Search inputs using Catalyst Input component
- [ ] Form controls using Catalyst Field/Label components
- [ ] Modal dialogs for file actions
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators

## Phase 5: Case Integration
- [ ] Associate documents with specific cases
- [ ] Case-specific document folders
- [ ] Document sharing between attorney and client
- [ ] Document access permissions by case role

## Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] File versioning and history
- [ ] Document signing integration (PDF.js)
- [ ] Bulk file operations
- [ ] File search by content
- [ ] Document templates and forms

## Phase 7: Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Responsive file upload interface
- [ ] Mobile-friendly file browser
- [ ] Touch-optimized file actions
- [ ] Mobile document viewing
